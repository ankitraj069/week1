Question_1: Currency
In Indian Currency notes and coins are available from Rs. 1, Rs. 2, Rs. 5, Rs. 10, Rs. 20, Rs. 50, Rs. 100, Rs. 200, Rs. 500, and Rs. 2000. A person saves a valid amount not exceeding a sum of Rs. 25000 with least number of notes or coins. Write a program to determine the number of notes or coins when the total saving amount is given. IT will display “Error” for any invalid cause of the program.

Input Format
An Integer representing the valid amount.

Output Format
10 space separated integers representing the frequency of the denomination respectively for Rs. 2000, Rs. 500, Rs. 200, Rs. 100, Rs. 50, Rs. 20, Rs. 10, Rs. 5, Rs. 2, Rs. 1.

Constraints
A valid amount is always greater than zero.

Problem Statement: Daily Market
Ram babu has five family members including parents, wife and only child. He spends Rs.X, Rs.Y, Rs.Z, Rs. T and Rs. W for Milk, non-veg, fruits, grocery and Vegetables each day respectively where Y is the maximum among all and every item must have some nonzero cost. If all X, Y, Z, T, W, and the current month and year is given, write a program to estimate the daily and monthly expanses for Ram babu for that month. If the input condition does not satisfy, it will display "Error" as output.
Input Format
The cost of the five items and the integer index of the month and the year. All are space separated.
Output Format
Space separated daily and monthly expanses.
Constraints
The cost of the five items would be a valid one. Month would be given as the corresponding integer ranging 1-12. A year would be valid integer.

Problem Statement: Swan & Eggs
A farmer has N number of swans of different ages. A swan can give approximately four eggs in a week when it will be 13 months of age. The farmer usually exports eggs monthly. If the valid ages of the swans are given in weeks at the beginning of a month, then write a program to compute the total number of eggs in the end of the month. A month is considered as 4 weeks.
Input Format
The number of swan and their weights in integer and separated by space.
 
Output Format
The total number of eggs at the end of the month.
Constraints
The age of any swan must be valid one.

Problem Statement: Magical Number
Let a N digit number is given, P and Q are two numbers, which hold the multiplication of all even and odd position digits respectively. If P is greater or equal to Q then the number is "Dominant", otherwise "Magical". The digit will not be considered, if it is zero and N must not be grater than ten. Write a program to find Dominant or magical number among K given numbers. For any invalid reason it will display "Error". The negative numbers are invalid.
Input Format
Total numbers input and the individual number separated by space.
Output Format
Space separated conclusion of each number whether they are "Magical", "Dominant" or "Error". 
Constraints
The numbers given never be negative. Zero in the digits never be considered in multiplication
